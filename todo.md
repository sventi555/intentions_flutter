- add linting and best practices (consts, disposal stuff probably)
- better loading content (or just remove some spinners)
- handle failed api calls on write operations more gracefully in all cases
- remove state errors from most providers (state errors should be handled from consumers probably)
- firestore rules for feed and notifications
- android production deployment

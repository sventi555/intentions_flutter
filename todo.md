- figure out how to make a production deployment to send to your phone
- add linting and best practices (consts, disposal stuff probably)

- better loading content (or just remove some spinners)
- handle failed api calls on write operations more gracefully in all cases
- remove state errors from most providers (state errors should be handled from consumers probably)

- empty follow page content
- empty profile page content (posts and intention lists)
- link to user from follow list
- create intention header (or some other way to give more context to user)

- figure out how to make a production deployment to send to your phone
- add linting and best practices (consts, disposal stuff probably)

- better loading content (or just remove some spinners)
- handle failed api calls on write operations more gracefully in all cases

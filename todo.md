- profile content when not followed private user
- empty follow page content
- link to user from follow list
- create intention header (or some other way to give more context to user)

- add linting and best practices (consts, disposal stuff probably)

- better loading content (or just remove some spinners)
- handle failed api calls on write operations more gracefully in all cases
